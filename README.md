# dev-space-tz


A platform for TDC meant to help identify and group developers and companies within the country with respect to their skills, experience and experties.

## Purpose

The purpose is to have a space for Tanzanian developers and companies, so that they may be able to collaborate and identify one another and if possible nurture one another to fruition

## Contribution

Currently we are at the initial stage of this. So just create an issue regarding the features you think will benefit the community.
To be able to track/prioritize and schedule each feature request, We humbly request you to submit each feature as a separate issue. You can submit as many features as you have but no more(hehe). Just attempt to read the currently available ones to avoid requesting duplicate features

## Further Discussions

Many are being discussed in our [telegram](https://t.me/tanzaniadeveloperscommunity) group. Feel free to join
